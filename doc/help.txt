Screen is a powerful program that allows your terminal session to use
multiple windows and retain context among multiple logins.
This version of screen is configured with a task bar at the bottom of
the window that shows: open windows, the current-OS, reboot-required,
updates-available, system-load, cpu-info, memory-info, and date/time.

Key mappings:
F2    Create a new window    |  F6    Detach from the session
F3    Go to the prev window  |  F7    Enter scrollback mode
F4    Go to the next window  |  F8    View all keybindings
F5    Close current window   |  F9    Configure screen-profiles
                             |  F12   Lock this terminal
Commands:
'screen -r'  - reattach      | 'man screen' - complete help

The escape key is currently set to <ctrl-<esckey>>
