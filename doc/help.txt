Screen is a powerful program that allows your terminal session to have
multiple windows and retain context between multiple logins. This
version of screen is configured with a task bar at the bottom of the
window that shows system status, pending updates, and which window you
are currently viewing.

Common mappings (where C- means ctrl):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
C-PgUp/Shift-Tab  Goto next window            | F1  Basic help (this)
C-PgDown          Goto previous window        | F2  Advanced help
C-Shift-Del       Detach screen               | F4  Create new window
C-g Esc           Use scrollback (Esc exits)  | F6  Close current window
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use 'screen -r' to reattach to a detached screen. Complete help on
screen can be obtained using the 'man screen' command. Please note that
screen is configured to remap the escape prefix from ctrl-A to ctrl-G.
