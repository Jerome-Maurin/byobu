Screen is a powerful program that allows your terminal session to use
multiple windows and retain context among multiple logins.
This version of screen is configured with a task bar at the bottom of
the window that shows system status, pending updates, and which window
you are currently viewing.

Key mappings:
F2    Create new window      |  F6    Detach from session
F3    Go to prev window      |  F7    Scrollback/copy mode
F4    Go to next window      |  F8    Advanced help
F5    Close this window      |  F9    Basic help (this)

Commands:
'screen -r'  - reattach      | 'man screen' - complete help

Note that the escape key has been changed from <ctrl-a> to <ctrl-g>.
