== History ==

In the days preceding the [[Ubuntu_Developer_Summit#Development|Ubuntu Developer Summit]] held on Google's Mountain View campus in December 2008, several Ubuntu developers, including Dustin Kirkland, Nicolas Barcet, and Dave Walker discussed alternative approaches to solving some long standing requests to add a graphical desktop to the Ubuntu Server.  They decided to collect the best hacks to GNU Screen they could find, and publish a better profile (or set of profiles) for [[GNU_Screen|GNU Screen]] on [[Ubuntu_(operating_system)|Ubuntu]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/04/ubuntu-brings-advanced-screen-features-to-the-masses.ars |title=Ubuntu brings advanced Screen features to the masses |publisher=Ars Technica |accessdate=2010-11-09 }}</ref>.  

Another 54 releases of screen-profiles were published before the project was renamed 'Byobu' on May 5, 2009<ref>{{cite web |url=https://launchpad.net/byobu/trunk/2.0 |title=byobu 2.0 released -- the project formerly known as screen-profiles |publisher=Launchpad |accessdate=2010-11-09 }}</ref>.  The new name reflected the dynamic, extensible nature beyond the original static, flat configuration profiles.
