.SH NAME
byobu \- wrapper script for seeding a user's byobu configuration and launching screen

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbyobu\fP is a script that launches GNU screen in the byobu configuration.  This enables the display of system information and status notifications within two lines at the bottom of the screen session. It also enables multiple tabbed terminal sessions, accessible through simple keystrokes.

.SH STATUS NOTIFICATIONS

\fBbyobu\fP supports a number of unique and interesting status notifications across the lowest two lines in the screen.  Each status notification item is independently configurable, enabled and disabled by the configuration utility.  The guide below helps identify each status item (in alphabetical order):

\fBapport\fP \- symbol displayed if there are pending crash reports; {!} symbol displayed on the lower bar toward the left, in black on an orange background

\fBarch\fP \- system architecture; displayed on the lower bar toward the left, in the default text color on the default background color

\fBbattery\fP \- battery information; display on the lower bar toward the right; |\-| indicates discharging, |+| indicates charging, |=| indicates fully charged;  when charging or discharging, the current battery capacity as a percentage is displayed;  the colours green, yellow, and red are used to give further indication of the battery's charge state

\fBservices\fP \- users can configure a list of services to monitor, define the SERVICES variable in $HOME/.byobu/status, a whitespace separated of services, each service should include the init name of the service, then a pipe, and then an abbreviated name or symbol to display when running; displayed in the lower bar toward the center in cyan on a white background

\fBcpu_count\fP \- the number of cpu's or cores on the system; displayed in the lower bar toward the right in the default text color on the default background, followed by a trailing 'x'

\fBcpu_freq\fP \- the current frequency of the cpu in GHz; displayed in the lower bar toward the right in white text on a light blue background

\fBcpu_temp\fP \- the cpu temperature in Celsius (default) or Fahrenheit, configure TEMP=F or TEMP=C in \fI$HOME/.byobu/statusrc\fP; displayed in the lower bar toward the right in yellow text on a black background; you may override the detected cpu temperature device by setting MONITORED_TEMP=/proc/acpi/whatever in \fI$HOME/.byobu/statusrc\fP

\fBcustom\fP \- user defined custom scripts; must be executable programs of any kind in \fI$HOME/.byobu/bin\fP; must be named N_NAME, where N is the frequency in seconds to refresh the status indicator, and NAME is the name of the script; N should not be less than 5 seconds; script should echo a small amount of text to standard out, standard error is discared; the indicator will be displayed in the lower panel, in inverted colors to your current background/foreground scheme, unless you manually specify the colors in your script's output; BEWARE, cpu-intensive custom scripts may impact your overall system performance and could upset your system administrator!
  Example: \fI~/.byobu/bin/1000_uname\fP
    #!/bin/sh
    printf "\\005{= bw}%s\\005{\-}" "$(uname -r)"

.SH WINDOWS

Each open window in the screen session is displayed in the upper bar toward the far left.  These are numbered, and include indicators as to activity in the window (see "activity" in \fBscreen\fP(1) for symbol definitions).  The current active window is highlighted by inverting the background/text from the rest of the window bar.

Users can create a list of windows to launch at startup in \fI~/.byobu/windows\fP.  This file is the same syntax as \fI~/.screenrc\fP, each line specifying a window using the "screen" command, as described in \fBscreen\fP(1).

User can also launch Byobu with unique window sets.  Users can store these as \fI~/.byobu/windows.[NAME]\fP, and launch Byobu with the environment variable \fBBYOBU_WINDOWS\fP.

For example:
  $ cat ~/.byobu/windows.ssh_sessions
  screen \-t localhost bash
  screen \-t aussie ssh root@aussie
  screen \-t beagle ssh root@beagle
  screen \-t collie ssh root@collie
  $ BYOBU_WINDOWS=ssh_sessions byobu

.SH UNITS OF MEASURE
byobu uses binary for measurements rather than decimal for KB, MB, and GB.  This means multiples of 1024 rather than multiples of 1000, in accordance with JEDEC Standard 100B.01.

.SH KEYBINDINGS

byobu keybindings can be user defined in /usr/share/byobu/keybindings/ (or within .screenrc if byobu-export was used). The common key bindings are:

\fBF2\fP \- Create a new window

\fBF3\fP \- Move to previous window

\fBF4\fP \- Move to next window

\fBF5\fP \- Reload profile

\fBF6\fP \- Detach from this session

\fBF7\fP \- Enter copy/scrollback mode

\fBF8\fP \- Re-title a window

\fBF9\fP \- Configuration Menu

\fBF12\fP \-  Lock this terminal

\fBCtrl-a $\fP \- show detailed status

\fBCtrl-a R\fP \- Reload profile

\fBCtrl-a !\fP \- Toggle key bindings on and off

\fBCtrl-a k\fP \- Kill the current window

\fBCtrl-a ~\fP \- Write the current window's scrollback buffer to \fI/var/run/screen/S-$USER/byobu-exchange\fP

.SH "BUGS"

PuTTY users have reported that the F2, F3, and F4 shortcut keys are not working properly.  PuTTY sends the same escape sequences as the linux console for F1-F4 by default.  You can fix this problem in the PuTTY config, Terminal -> Keyboard -> Function keys: Xterm R6.  See: \fIhttp://www.mail-archive.com/screen-users@gnu.org/msg01525.html\fP

Mac OSX terminal users have reported 'flashing text'.  You can fix this in the advanced settings of the terminal application, with 'Declare Terminal As: xterm-color'.
