.TP

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbyobu\-export\fP is a program that creates a monolithic .screenrc profile, and copies the status notification scripts into an archive file.  This archive can then be extracted on a target system where \fBbyobu\fP is not installed (perhaps because the program is not packaged for that distribution, or perhaps because the administrator has not installed the package).
