# This file defines the common key bindings
#
# For a keybinding to live in the "common" area, it must be verified to
# work in at least:
#  * gnome-terminal
#  * console tty
#
# bindkey commands should be followed by a comment that will be used in the
# help file (one day).  The command should be formated as:
#   <keys> | explanation

# Changed the default escape from ctrl-a to ctrl-g, so as not to conflict
# with emacs' ctrl-a
escape ^Gg
			# F1 -> 'help' in gnome-terminal
register n "^g^c ^gA"	# Goes with the F2 definition
bindkey -k k2 process n	# F2 | Create new window (and name it)
bindkey -k k3 prev	# F3 | Previous Window
bindkey -k k4 next	# F4 | Next Window
bindkey -k k5 kill	# F5 | Close window
bindkey -k k6 detach	# F6 | Detach from this session
bindkey -k k7 copy	# F7 | Enter copy/scrollback mode
bindkey -k k8 help	# F8 | Advanced help/keybindings
bindkey -k k9 screen -t help 0 screen-profiles-helper # F9 | Welcome screen
			# F10 -> 'toolbar' in gnome-terminal
			# F11 -> 'fullscreen' in gnome-terminal
			# F12

# power detach
register x "^g^d D"
bindkey ^[[3;6~ process x # C-shift-del | Detach and logout
