    such that it's easier to make these theme-able
  * windows/common: suggest w3m rather than elinks
  * byobu-status, profiles/common, profiles_generator/profile.skel,
    statusrc: obviate the need for separate profiles per color; read the
    profile colors from a config file, and use a special "color" status
    item to dynamically render it
  * bin/menu: add a space to the -r test, LP: #490894
  * profiles_generator/profile.skel: use the reverse color for the current
    window highlighting; works better with odd color combinations, maximizes

    documentation
  * debian/profile: establish symlinks for the color profiles to ensure
    smooth upgrades; all point to the common profile now
  * byobu-config, statusrc: enable whoami, hostname, ip_address by default;
    it seems I almost *always* turn these on, seem useful; re-disable if
    there are noisy complaints
  * byobu-janitor, statusrc: seed the ~/.byobu/status file with the

    - comprehensively rewritten, basically put all of byobu's installed
      files in ~/.byobu, and use some clever sed scripts to fixup paths
    - drop the color selection, no longer necessary

    - define and use a color function for all status indicators, gives

  * bin/updates-available, profiles/common:
    - reworked to be far more efficient, and accurate, LP: #427373
    - look at the timestamp on /var/lib/apt, and only update cache
      if /var/lib/apt has been touched since the cache
    - in particular, these changes fix a bug when the user does an
      apt-get install or upgrade, and changes to the update status
      are not update for up to an hour later; with these fixes, it's
      nearly immediate

    - for $PWD to work, we'd need screen to support two separate

  * statusrc, byobu-status, byobu-export, debian/install: source default
    status states, rather than the big case statement, performance
    improvement for all status, also reduces the number of places to
    touch when a new status script is added
  * byobu-status: move all of the cleanup hacks to byobu-janitor; create
    a find_script() function that allows for scripts in both /usr/lib and
    $HOME/.byobu
  * byobu, byobu-janitor, debian/install, profiles/common,
    profiles/profile.skel: remove janitorial logic scattered across

    their profile
  * bin/reboot_required, byobu-janitor, byobu-status, byobu.1,

    reload-required file when making changes
  * byobu-janitor: add fix for the collapsed disk* and network* status
    items
  * byobu-config, windows/common: add some examples in the common windows

    file is empty, show the examples in the default window management
    panel

    byobu-config, byobu-export, byobu-status, byobu.1, debian/control,
    doc/help.txt, profiles/common, rpm/byobu.spec: massive changeset, moving
    all status scripts from *-* to *_*; this allows us to source the
    ~/.byobu/status file, rather than grepping through it for configuration
    information, yielding significant performance improvements
  * profiles/common: massive rework of status frequencies; use prime numbers
    to minimize collisions; increase/decrease a few, based on statistical
    testing of required runtimes
  * bin/wifi_quality: significant performance improvements, remove unneeded
    route call, cache iwconfig output so that it's only called once
  * bin/processes: improve performance by listing /proc (doubles the speed)
  * bin/network, profiles/common, profiles/profile.skel, byobu-config,
    byobu-status, byobu.1, rpm/byobu.spec: merge network_down and

    causes performance problems
  * bin/disk_available, bin/disk_used, bin/hostname, bin/ip_address,
    bin/mem_available, byobu-status: drop grepping of status config file,

  * bin/cpu-freq: drop "cat" and just use awk, don't printf twice,
    performance improvements
  * bin/updates_available: drop "cat", and just use grep, performance
