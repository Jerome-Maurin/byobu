screen-profiles (1.9-0ubuntu1) jaunty; urgency=low

  [Nicolas Barcet]
  * use gettext in screen-profiles-helper (LP: #317245)

  [ Dustin Kirkland ]
  * keybindings/common: fix leading whitespace on new window creation
    LP: #317558
  * keybindings/common, doc/help.txt: change the default escape sequence
    back to ctrl-a
  * profiles/common, bin/updates-available: the updates-available script now
    caches its value, expiring that value every 60 minutes; so subsequent
    checks are much cheaper;  we can allow the screen status script to run
    more frequently now, since most will be cache checks; we'll really benefit
    from this in Jaunty
  * debian/control: remove buildeps on gettext, po4a, which are only called
    in the prebuild; depend on ${misc:Depends} with debhelper >= 5
  * debian/rules: use dh_testdir in get-orig-source, dh_clean to clean up
    build; run as 'debian/rules get-orig-source'; removing dh_installdirs as
    its not needed; add dh_md5sums
  * debian/dirs: not needed, removing
  * debian/copyright: updated to use canonical.com address, attribute
    Canonical copyright, and mention Nick as co-author
  * select-screen-profile.1: fixed typo
  * bin/*, *: use -e for shell scripts
  * bin/updates-available: cache updates available count in the user's
    homedir, rather than world-writable /var/tmp (race conditions exist)
  * screen-launcher.1, screen-profiles-helper.1: new manpages

    updated with mem and load status scripts
  * profiles/common: fix scrollback, LP: #309393

    unnecessary;  this will break early users, they will need to re-run
    select-screen-profile to fix
  * screen-launcher, screen-install, debian/install: install screen-launcher
    to /usr/bin, drop the symlinking to ~/.screen-launcher, just install by
