  * screen: wrapper script should add a -c arg, and specify your chosen

    from happening to upgrading users by pruning source of ~/.screenrc-profile
    from ~/.screenrc, LP: #323756
  * screen-launcher-install: test executability of screen-launcher; install to
    .profile unconditionally, and only .bash_profile and .bash_login if they
    exist; sanitize the environment; LP: #319691, LP: #321869
  * screen-launcher-uninstall: test writability of file to prune; prune from
    .profile, .bash_profile, and .bash_login

    as a last step (allowing for overrides)

    profile as "ubuntu-light"

    duplicated ubuntu and ubuntu-light profiles

    to the screen script, such that it is executed each time screen is run,
    rather than on screen profile selection only

    individual user's ~/.screenrc-keybindings file

    LP: #317558
  * keybindings/common, doc/help.txt: change the default escape sequence
    back to ctrl-a
  * profiles/common, bin/updates-available: the updates-available script now
    caches its value, expiring that value every 60 minutes; so subsequent

    more frequently now, since most will be cache checks; we'll really benefit
    from this in Jaunty
  * debian/control: remove buildeps on gettext, po4a, which are only called
    in the prebuild; depend on ${misc:Depends} with debhelper >= 5

    build; run as 'debian/rules get-orig-source'; removing dh_installdirs as
    its not needed; add dh_md5sums

  * debian/copyright: updated to use canonical.com address, attribute
    Canonical copyright, and mention Nick as co-author
  * select-screen-profile.1: fixed typo

  * bin/updates-available: cache updates available count in the user's
    homedir, rather than world-writable /var/tmp (race conditions exist)

  * screen-launcher, screen-install, debian/install: install screen-launcher
    to /usr/bin, drop the symlinking to ~/.screen-launcher, just install by
