byobu (2.12-0ubuntu1) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Massive changeset for LP: #386546 ]
  * bin/cpu_count, bin/cpu_freq, bin/disk_available, bin/disk_used,
    bin/ec2_cost, bin/ip_address, bin/load_average, bin/mem_available,
    bin/mem_used, bin/network_down, bin/network_up, bin/reboot_required,
    bin/temp_c, bin/temp_f, bin/updates_available, bin/wifi_quality,
    byobu-config, byobu-export, byobu-status, byobu.1, debian/control,
    doc/help.txt, profiles/common, rpm/byobu.spec: massive changeset, moving
    all status scripts from *-* to *_*; this allows us to source the
    ~/.byobu/status file, rather than grepping through it for configuration
    information, yielding significant performance improvements
  * profiles/common: massive rework of status frequencies; use prime numbers
    to minimize collisions; increase/decrease a few, based on statistical
    testing of required runtimes
  * bin/wifi_quality: significant performance improvements, remove unneeded
    route call, cache iwconfig output so that it's only called once
  * bin/processes: improve performance by listing /proc (doubles the speed)
  * bin/network, profiles/common, profiles/profile.skel, byobu-config,
    byobu-status, byobu.1, rpm/byobu.spec: merge network_down and
    network_up to a single status script; too much duplication of code,
    causes performance problems
  * bin/disk_available, bin/disk_used, bin/hostname, bin/ip_address,
    bin/mem_available, byobu-status: drop grepping of status config file,
    source it instead, should improve performance
  * bin/reboot-required: don't exit 1 when a reboot is not required
  * bin/cpu-freq: drop "cat" and just use awk, don't printf twice,
    performance improvements
  * bin/updates_available: drop "cat", and just use grep, performance
    improvement
  * bin/load_average: drop "cat", and just use awk, performance
    improvement
  * bin/network: pull network bytes directly from /proc/net/dev, performance
    improvement
  * bin/users: use pgrep -c, performance improvement
  * bin/time, bin/date, bin/reboot-required: use case statement, performance
    improvement
  * bin/battery: ensure that only one present battery is displayed in the
    status area
  * bin/disk, bin/disk_used, profiles/common, profiles/profile.skel:
    collapse disk usage down to a single status script for performance,
    support disk partitions as well as mountpoints in ~/.byobu/disk,
    LP: #388053

  * byobu-config, debian/rules, keybindings/common.disable,
    keybindings/f-keys, keybindings/screen-escape-keys: massive fix for
    byobu keybindings; use ctrl-a-! to toggle on/off byobu's f-keys;
    also support a new keyset, screen-escape-keys which profiles ctrl-a
    keybindings for common byobu functions, LP: #380944

  * bin/mail, byobu-status, byobu.1, profiles/common,
    profiles/profile.skel, rpm/byobu.spec: add a mail status notification,

  * byobu-config: fix keybinding disabling for non-standard escape sequences,

  [ Dustin Kirkland ]
  * byobu: support Debian/Ubuntu's diversion of screen to screen.real,

  * debian/release.sh: handle version incrementing in the rpm specfile
  * bin/disk-used: fix situations where df output wraps to the next
    line
  * bin/logo: check that lsb_release is available before using it
  * bin/release: try to grab both distro and version from /etc/issue
    if that's what we're forced to use
  * bin/updates-available: improve counting of yum updates available
  * bin/ip-address,whoami,release,hostname: use +b rather than =b,
    colors look bad on the light* profiles
  * bin/ip-address: hostname -i doesn't always work, use ifconfig
    instead, LP: #376080
  * bin/network-down,network-up,updates-available: use /var/run/screen
    for status cache files, to keep from waking up the disk
  * bin/battery: color the entire battery the same way, only use 3 tones,
    Green/Yellow/Red (6 was too confusing), always use black text on
    capital G/Y/R background
  * byobu-export: tar files with owner/group as root/root, LP: #371025
  * byobu, debian/install, motd+shell, profiles/byoburc: launch screen
    with a simple config file that includes the chosen profile plus
    the chosen windows; but on refresh, only reload the chosen profile;
    revert previous hack that did this by creating a temporary config
    file and broke on hardy, LP: #375309
  * screen-launcher: don't use the -x argument if launching a new screen,
