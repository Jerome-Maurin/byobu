Description: a set of useful profiles and a profile-switcher for GNU screen
 byobu includes a set of profiles for the GNU screen window manager.
 These profiles are quite useful on server machines which are not running
 a graphical desktop.  The 'screen' command provides a number of advanced
 features are not necessarily exposed in the default profile.  These profiles
 provide features such as status bars, clocks, notifiers (reboot required,
 updates available), etc.  The profile-switcher allows users to quickly switch
 their .screenrc to any of the available profiles.
