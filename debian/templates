_Description: Launch Byobu at shell login for all users?
 Byobu can be launched automatically on all shell logins (via the console,
 SSH, etc.), to provide a screen session manager.

 If you select this option, a symlink will be created in /etc/profile.d.
 This setting is system-wide, for all user logins. Individual users can
 opt out by using the utility "byobu-config" or by creating the file
 "disable-autolaunch" in their byobu configuration directory.
