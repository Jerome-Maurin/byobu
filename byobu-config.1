.SH NAME
byobu-config \- Configuration utility for byobu

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbyobu\-config\fP is an application that can configure a number of options available in the byobu utility.

The menu provided by the \fBbyobu\fP should be self-explanatory.



.SH "BUGS"

PuTTY users have reported that the F2, F3, and F4 shortcut keys are not working properly.  PuTTY sends the same escape sequences as the linux console for F1-F4 by default.  You can fix this problem in the PuTTY config by changing the function keys to 'xterm R6'.  See: \fIhttp://www.mail-archive.com/screen-users@gnu.org/msg01525.html\fP
