.SH "BUGS"

PuTTY users have reported that the F2, F3, and F4 shortcut keys are not working properly.  PuTTY sends the same escape sequences as the linux console for F1-F4 by default.  You can fix this problem in the PuTTY config by changing the function keys to 'xterm R6'.  See: \fIhttp://www.mail-archive.com/screen-users@gnu.org/msg01525.html\fP
