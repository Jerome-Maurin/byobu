Optional parameter specifying the desired color scheme.  If omitted, the program will interactively prompt for this value.
.TP
.B \-f TARGET.tar.gz

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBscreen\-profiles\-export\fP is a program that creates a monolithic .screenrc profile, and copies the status notification scripts into an archive file.  This archive can then be extracted on a target system where \fBscreen\-profiles\fP is not installed (perhaps because the program is not packaged for that distribution, or perhaps because the administrator has not installed the package).
